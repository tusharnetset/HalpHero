The geolocation function of the mobile app helps the user to quickly locate nearby care providers and care seekers. The onus is on the users to verify and choose profiles based on their own judgment. Care seekers can submit reviews on those care providers they have previously hired. Care providers  will also upload certificates, IDâ€™s, references, qualifications, Garda Vetting and more to their profile. The app also offers a chat service where users can communicate with one another to fully express themselves in what they want and expect. Questions on the job can also be asked by this means.</p>
